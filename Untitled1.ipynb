        "Encapsulation: This is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which can protect the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows the user to interact with objects at a high level, without needing to understand the internal complexities.\n",

        "   - Instance methods are methods that operate on an instance of a class. They can access and modify the instance's attributes.\n",

        "### Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes during inheritance. It is especially relevant in cases of **multiple inheritance** because it determines the order in which base classes are checked when a method is called on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python follows the **C3 linearization** algorithm (also called the **C3 superclass linearization**) to construct the MRO. This ensures that the method lookup follows a consistent and logical order. The MRO ensures:\n",
        "- Child classes are checked before their parent classes.\n",
        "- Parents are checked in the order they are inherited.\n",
        "- In case of multiple inheritance, Python resolves conflicts between methods using the C3 linearization rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retrieving MRO Programmatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides two ways to retrieve the MRO of a class:\n",
        "1. **`__mro__` attribute**: This is a special attribute that stores the MRO of a class.\n",
        "2. **`mro()` method**: This method on a class returns the MRO as a list of classes.\n",
        "\n",

        "### Explanation of MRO in this Example:\n",
        "- **Class `D`** inherits from both `B` and `C`, which both inherit from `A`.\n",
        "- When you call `D.mro()` or access `D.__mro__`, Python constructs a linear method resolution order using the C3 linearization. The MRO for `D` is:\n",

        "  - `C` (after `B`, Python moves to the second parent of `D`)\n",
        "  - `A` (common base class for both `B` and `C`)\n",
        "  - `object` (all classes in Python eventually inherit from the base class `object`)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Use of MRO:\n",
        "The MRO ensures that methods are invoked in the correct order when dealing with multiple inheritance. If you call `d.method()` on an instance `d` of class `D`, Python will follow the MRO and execute the method defined in the first class in the MRO that contains it (in this case, `B`).\n",

        "The **Diamond Problem** is a classic issue in object-oriented programming languages that support multiple inheritance. It occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class, leading to ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",

Since `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, it inherits two copies of the attributes or methods from `A` (one through `B` and one through `C`). This can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency about which method or attribute to use, especially if `B` and `C` override methods from `A`.\n",

        "1. **Static Method**:\n",
        "   - The `is_leap_year` method is defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator, indicating that it does not operate on an instance of the class or modify class state.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Leap Year Logic**:\n",
        "   - The method checks if the year is divisible by 4.\n",
        "   - If divisible by 4, it then checks if it is also divisible by 100. If so, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.\n",
        "   - If not divisible by 100, it’s a leap year if divisible by 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Usage**:\n",
        "   - The `is_leap_year` method is called directly on the class `DateUtils` without creating an instance, as static methods are independent of instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Is 2024 a leap year? True\n",
        "Is 1900 a leap year? False\n",
        "Is 2000 a leap year? True\n",
        "Is 2023 a leap year? False\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- The `@staticmethod` decorator is used to define a method that doesn't require access to instance or class-specific data.\n",
        "- The `is_leap_year` static method provides a simple way to check if a year is a leap year based on well-defined rules."
